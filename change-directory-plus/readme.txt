###CDP is a user friendly way to navigate directorys inside the terminal 

#Add the following to your bashrc file to use more efficiently:
	alias cdp = python3 /home/"file direcory"/cdp.py

To show hidden content use:
Use python3 /home/"file direcory"/cdp.py -sh

#How to use
	Move selection up = w
	Move selection down = s
	Move into selected directory = a
	Move out of current directory = d
	Enter directory = e
	Show/hide directory content = r
	Quit terminal = escape
	exit cdp = q
	Search file name = f
	
#Alternative keys
	Move selection up = up arrow
	Move selection down = down arrow
	Move into selected directory = right arrow
	Move out of current directory = left arrow
	Enter directory = enter
